        I am a new entrant to the field of geoscience computing. My previous work, which I
        departed last year, was in medical devices. For the past 6 months, I have been learning
        scientific programming with an emphasis on geoscientific applications, and am now
        beginning the process of searching for a job in this field. As a cis-gendered white male, I
        am aware---and have become increasingly so, through the URGE curriculum---of the
        extent to which this field has historically been, and remains, a place which is accepting
        of people like me, and that not all people feel the comfort I do in these spaces. Even
        more so, I am coming to understand the ways in which the overt racism of this and
        many other spaces in contemporary American culture is actively hostile to BIPOC
        participation. Through URGE, I commit to crafting a set of D.E.I. Commitments to
        guide my future career, which I will both share in a public manner (on a personal
        website, for example) and with future employers and colleagues, and use to guide
        decision making and actions to center equity and inclusion in my future workplace(s).

        <h1>Objectives</h1>
        <p>
            I'm currently seeking a Python engineering role 
            in open source tooling and/or earth science analytics.
            As an extovert who also thrives on deep technical immersion, 
            I'm looking to contribute my skills to a challenging and impactful
            engineering problems while also serving in a community outreach and/or 
            teaching capacity.
            <br><br>
            Workplaces which value professional development and wellbeing are of the
            greatest interest to me. Lifelong learning is one of my greatest passions.
            In this phase of my career, I look forward to dramatically expanding my 
            software engineering expertise as well as my knowledge of adjacent disciplies
            such as applied math.
            <br><br>
            While the earth sciences have historically been inexorably linked with
            extractive industry, I seek to devote my work to scientific applications
            which facilitate climate change adaptation & mitigation, renewable energy
            and resource development, and which spark curiosity, enthusiasm, and
            stewardship of the natural world.
            <br><br>
            I will update this page as time goes along, and welcome follow-up conversations 
            on these or related subjects.

            In his 1962 <a href="https://progressive.org/magazine/letter-nephew/">
            A Letter to My Nephew</a>, James Baldwin writes:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "To act is to be committed and to be committed is to be in danger."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            More recently, Merrick Garland
            <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/videos/watch/senator-booker-questions-attorney-general-nominee-merrick-garland" target="_blank">
            spoke of his indebtedness</a> to the United States of America for sheltering
            his family from anti-Semitic persecution, and his desire work on behalf of
            those communities, most notably BIPOC communities, who are denied 
            equal opportunities for safety, justice, and personal advancement.
            <br><br>
            As a Jewish American whose own ancestors also found safe haven in the US, 
            Garland's sentiments resonate deeply. Though my position may not be
            as exalted as his, the priviledge and opportunity I am afforded
            nonetheless carries with it great responsibility. My current participation 
            in Unlearning Racism in Geoscience (URGE) is directed towards crafting
            a set of commitments with which to hold myself accountable to this work.
            I will share further regarding D.E.I. commitments at the conclusion 
            of the URGE curriculum. 
            <br><br>
            Taking an international view, I commit to understanding how my work as a
            technologist can be of greatest benefit to users in the Global South.
            This includes understanding accessibility issues such as interface 
            languages and platforms (desktop vs. mobile), in addition to use-case
            considerations such as agricultural forecasting, flooding, and other symptoms
            of climate change.
            <br><br>
            Of all the dangers suggested by Baldwin's prescient Letter, the dual risks of
            inaction and performative action are themselves even more dangerous, both 
            morally and practically. I hope that my future colleagues will hold me 
            accountable to the fact that "inclusivity is an action," should I ever fail
            to do so myself.

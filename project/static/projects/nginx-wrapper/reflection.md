This site's creation was a crash-course in full stack web development. The content, of course, required exploration of HTML, CSS, some JS, and the Flask framework. Some of the most interesting lessons, however, were in devops: hosting, proxies, and security. While I'd previously experimented with PaaS providers such as Heroku, it was important to me that this site be done on IaaS: I wanted to build (and learn) as much as possible.

After some trial-and-error, I settled on a development strategy which has worked quite well. The general approach consists of creating the site's content as a standalone repository, to facilitate fast iterative development. The content layer is then implemented as a Git submodule to the devops layer, which includes the Docker and Nginx infrastructure. This modular approach has the added benefit of making each of the two layers portable: either can be easily swapped or reused.

The <a href="https://github.com/cisaacstern/nginx-wrapper/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">README</a> for this repo is an evolving technical record of my deployment approach. For ongoing maintenance and updates, I've found pushing changes to GitHub from my local machine, and then logging into the cloud server to pull changes and rebuild the hosted Docker image, to be a relatively painless process. To even further reduce toil, and prepare for eventual work scenarios managing a larger number of sites, I'd like to move to CI/CD soon.

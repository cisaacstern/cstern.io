The graphic above indicates the technology behind this site: this is a server of <a href="https://panel.holoviz.org" target="_blank">Panel</a> applications. Panel facilitates rapidly transforming scientific Python modules into interactive webapps and, in my humble opinion, does this better than anything else currently available. The devops strategy employed for this site is quite close to the one I developed for <a href="https://cstern.io/projects/nginx-wrapper">nginx-wrapper</a>, with a few changes in the Nginx configuration to allow bidirectional websocket communication, as described <a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html#reverse-proxying-with-nginx-and-ssl" target="_blank">here</a> in the Bokeh docs.

I experimented with many stylistic approaches for these apps, including Panel's built-in <a href="https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/templates/React.html#templates-gallery-react" target="_blank">React Template</a>. Ultimately, I chose to go with a custom template, modified from the official example provided <a href="https://panel.holoviz.org/user_guide/Templates.html" target="_blank">here</a>, as it provided minimalist yet responsive base ontop of which to add CSS styles and, in a few cases, some custom JavaScript.

Splitting the static content of cstern.io and the interactive content of apps.cstern.io onto separate servers was not strictly necessary, as Nginx does make it relatively easy to proxy all of this content onto a single domain. In the end, however, I did decide to split the deployment, mainly to keep the Nginx configurations and docker-compose YAML files for each site smaller and more manageable. Incrementally greater hosting costs seemed like a fair trade for the added maintainability of discretization.

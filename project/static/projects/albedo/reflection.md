Albedo is a measure of the proportion of solar radiation reflected from a surface. This proportion depends on the material properties of the surface itself (bare earth is less reflective than snow, generally speaking). It also depends on the sun's position in relation to the slope and aspect of a given topographic location.

<a href="https://people.eri.ucsb.edu/~nbair/storage/bair_et_al_2015_frontiers.pdf" target="_blank">CUES</a> is a snow pack study site located in California's Sierra Nevada, jointly administered by UC Santa Barbara and the US Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL). The 50+ scientific instruments installed at CUES include upward and downward looking radiometers and a LiDAR scanner. The colocation of these three instruments provides the opportunity for measuring terrain-corrected albedo.

Prior literature has investigated terrain correction using a best-fit planar regression to the LiDAR pointcloud. The aim of this project is to investigate rasterized correction with so-called "horizon" modeling to determine when each cell in the reconstructed topography is exposed to direct solar radiation. Building the infrastructure for this analysis has been the inspiration behind many of my apps, including <a href="https://cstern.io/projects/lidar-nn">lidar-nn</a>, <a href="https://cstern.io/projects/ufunc-correct">ufunc-correct</a>, and <a href="https://cstern.io/projects/when-rad">when-rad</a>.

The data for this project is all openly accessible via <a href="https://snow.ucsb.edu" target="blank">snow.ucsb.edu</a>. Were it not for the generous mentorship of the CUES team, however, I would neither have **(a)** become aware of this fascinating research question nor **(b)** gained sufficient scientific context to approach it. I am grateful to them for their guidance, and look forward to contributing my research efforts to a future publication on this subject.

# Motivation

It all started with the formula $e^x$.

# What Works

How its going. Here's some `inline code` that's pretty cool.

Here's some more text.

# Room To Grow

Here's an example of multiline code which could be improved:

```{.python .codehilite}
from engine import RunForrestRun

"""Test code for syntax highlighting!"""

class Foo:
	def __init__(self, var):
		self.var = var
		self.run()

	def run(self):
		RunForrestRun()  # run along!
```

I'm aware there's a better way but haven't done it yet.
